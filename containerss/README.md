### Vector

First Principles P/1133

> "Boxed" means the vector can reference any datatype you want;
> "unboxed" represents raw values without pointer indirection
> "Slicing" refers to slicing off a portion, or creating a sub-array.
> The Vector type is designed for making slicing much cheaper than it otherwise would be.
