# Leftist Heaps

## in Haskell Cookbook

## in Purely Functional Data Structure P/27

(leftist heap is considered simple in both FP and imperative)

> Heaps are often implemented as heap-ordered trees, in which the element
> at each node is no larger than the elements at its children. Under this
> ordering, the minimum element in a tree is always at the root.
